# React + Router + Dom

This project is related to React router dom practice

Where I have implemented Router dom with Tailwind CSS and hooks like useEffect,useState,useParams

Also there is one api call Random Dog image which fetch latest dog image 

In this project I have used NavLink which is better than <a> tag because <a> tag refresh the whole page whenever we call it.

Attaching some ScreenShots of the project below :
